## Advantages of Unsupervised Learning
- 🟢 **Handles Complex Tasks**: Suitable for complex tasks compared to supervised ones because they work with unlabeled datasets.
- 🟢 **Preference for Unlabeled Data**: Often preferred for tasks involving unlabeled data since labeling data can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

## Disadvantages of Unsupervised Learning
- 🔴 **Less Accurate Output**: The output may not be as accurate since the dataset is unlabeled and the algorithms are not trained with predefined outputs.
- 🔴 **Difficult to Work With**: Unlabeled data is challenging as it lacks labels, making it hard to map inputs to desired outputs.
