# Machine Learning :- 
UNIT 1 :- 
-> Machine Learning is a Ai technique that teaches a computer to learn from experience. Machine learning algorithm use computational methods to learn. Information directly from data relying on a predetermined equation as a model.
The algorithm adaptively improve their performance as the number of Sample of learning increases.
machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allow a computer to learn from data and improve their perrformance over time without being explicitly being programmed.
learn from data.
finding the pattern .
making the prediction.
improving over the time.

# Type of machine learning : - 
Supervised Learning 
Unsupervised Learning 
Semi supervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning
# Supervised Learning :- 
Supervised machine learnig based on the supervision. In the supervised machine learning , we trained the machine with labelled dataset and based on training we predict the output. These algorithm feed the historical input and output data in the machine learnig algorithm , with processing the each input/ output pair that allow the algorithm to shift the model closely aligned the desired result. The main goal of supervised learning technique the input variable(x) with output variable (y). Some real example of supervised learning machine are risk assessment, fraud detection , spam detection etc.
# Types of supervised learning algorithm :- 
## Regression Algorithm : - 
1. Linear regression algorithm.
2. Multivariate algorithm
3. Lasso Regression
4. Decission Tree Algorithm
## Classification Algorithm :-  
     1. Random Forest Algorithm
      2. Decission Tree Algortihm
      3.Logestic Regression Algorithm
      4. Support Vector Machine Algorithm
## Naive Bays Classifier
## Neural Network
### Regression Algorithm :- 
 1. predict the output value by identifying the linear relationship between real or continuous.
2. Regression Algorithm include the linear regression algorithm, Multivariate algorithm, lasso regression , Decission Tree algorithm.
3. Example of regression algorithm are weather forecasting , temperature and salry and house price.
## Classification Algorithm : - 
 1. Classification Algorithm Include the categorical value such as predicating value include the situation that mail which we send is spam or not.
 2. classification Algorithm are Random forest algorithm, Decission tree algorithm, Logistic Regression Algorithm, Support Vector Maachine ALgorithm.

## Naive Bay's Classifier: - 
1. Naive Bay's Classifier basically works on large dataset .
2. Naive Bay's classifier is familiar of generative learning algorithm that model the input distribution of a given class or category.
3. Naive Bay's Algorithm works on the decission tree which can get the accomodate of regression and classification.

##  Neural Networks :- 
 1. simulate the way of human brain which is linked to the nodes which has the huge amount of data that can be accessed by natural language processing , image recognition and image creation.

### Advantage of supervised learning :-
1 . supervised learning works on the labelled dataset which can easily accessed by the class of an object.
2 . These algorithm mainly helpful in predicting the output on the prior experience.
### Disadvantage of supervised learning :-

1. These algorithm can not works on the complex tasks.
2. it may predict the wrong output if the tested data is differnt from the training data.
3. it require the lots of computational time to train the algorithm.

### Application of supervised learning :- 
1 . Image Segementation
2.  fraud detection
3. spam detection 
4. Medical Diagnosis
5. Speech Recognition.

## UnSupervised learning :- 
1. Unsupervised Learning do not need any supervision .
2. In the unsupervised learning the machine is trained on the unlabelled dataset the output which predict are without any supervison.
3. In the unsupervised learning when we trained the model with data , that data should no be classified ,labelled and the model act wihout any supervision.
4. The main aim of unsupervisesd learning algorithm is to grouped or classified the unsorted dataset according to the similarities , pattern and  differences .
5. Machine are instructed to find the hidden pattern from the input dataset.
## Types of unsupervised learning: -
1. Clustering
2. Association
### Clustering : - 
 1. The clustering is a techinque when we want to find the inherent groups from the data.
 2. It is way to group the object into cluster such that object with same similarities remain in one group and the object with no simoilarities remain in the otheer group.
 3. we can cluster the object of the customer having the same purchasing item.
    #### Some of the clustering algorithm are :-
      1. k means clustering algorithm
      2. Means shifting Algorithm
      3. DBSCAN algorithm
      4. Principal Component analysis
      5. Independent Component Analysis
### Association : -
  1 . Association is an unsupervised learning techinque which find the interesting relation among the variable within the dataset.
  2. The main of learning algorithm to find the dependency on the one data item to another data item and map those data accordingly variable so that it can generate 
 maximum profits.
  3. Example of association is market basket analysis,  web usage mining ,  continuous  production .
  ## Advantage of Unsupervised Learning :- 
   1. These algorithm can be used for complex tasks as compared to the supervised  ones because this algorithm works on the unlabelled dataset.
   2. Unsupervised algorithm is mostly preferable for various tasks for unlabeled dataset as easier to labelled dataset.
##  Disadvantage of unsupervised learning :- 
 1. The output of unsupervised learning is not accurate as the dataset is not labelled and algorithm are not trained on exact output in prior.
 2. Working with unsupervised learning is more difficult as it work on the unlabelled dataset that does not map out with output.
 ### Application on unsupervised learning :-
 1. Network Analysis :- Unsupervised learning is used for identify the plagiarism and copyright in the document network analysis of the text for scho
